# Trismegistos Data Scraper

This is a simple tool for scraping data from the Trismegistos database

The scraped data for Demotic texts are stored in the repo, as well as a csv with the results. Use those to plot number of texts by date.

You can modify the script to scrape other sorts of data (e.g. Greek texts)

## Demotic Results

![Demotic Data](TM_texts.eps)

The method for generating the plot is adapted from:

* Van Beek, B., & Depauw, M. (2013). Quantifying Imprecisely Dated Sources: A New Inclusive Method for Charting Diachronic Change in Graeco-Roman Egypt. *Ancient Society*, *43*, 101-114.
